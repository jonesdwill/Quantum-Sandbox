# Quantum-Sandbox
This repo is a diary for quantum computing learning and experiment. It contains the following:
 - **Coinflip**: Basic manipulation of qubit and familiarity with IBM backend. 
 - **Random Number Generator**:  What it says on the tin. Can generate large random numbers.
      - **quantum_rng.py**: A more formal Script. Can be used to random integers in some range.
      - Want to add complex, float and string generation, and turn into a package.
 - **Grover's Algorithm**: Can be used to perform a search of an unstructured search space in $\big{O}(\sqrt{N})$.
      - **grovers_algorithm.py** Proof of concept set of functions to find target integers in a list.
      - Want to adapt to graph theory to solve other problems such as travelling salesman.
 - **Cryptography**: Implementation of Shor's algorithm to factorise 15 on QC.
