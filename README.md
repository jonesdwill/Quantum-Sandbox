# Quantum-Sandbox
This repo contains all of my quantum computing experiments. It contains the following:
 - **Coinflip**: Basic superposition manipulation of qubit and use of IBM backend. 
 - **Random Number Generator**:  What it says on the tin. Can generate large numbers with a theoretical true-random, if you ignore noise etc.
      - **quantum_rng.py**: A more formal Script that can generate a list of random integers in some range.
